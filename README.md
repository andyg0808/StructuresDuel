StructuresDuel
==============

This is the repository for the "Duel of the Data Structures" project.

Our initial "Team Project Proposal" is written in Pandoc Markdown, and may be
found in the file **proposal.mkd**. It has been revised to reflect recent
conversations.

The Java code that will do our data structures testing may be found in
subdirectories of **src/**. **patricia-trie** is the implementation of a trie
that we're using for now.
