# Project Update Notes

### TL;DR: We're basically completely ready to start final study and analyze the data.

## Some Notes

1. Look into decreasing chance of outliers. (Are they because the JVM/caches have to warm up each time?)

1. Stick to the .95 power level, seeing as we have the tools to achieve this relatively easily compared to other groups. (Just my personal opinion, if everyone would like to switch to the .80 power because of convenience I'm perfectly fine with this too.)

1. Include an interaction plot for the final study.

1. There are a lot of red commas added throughout the document, look into formatting large numbers with commas for next time.

This concludes her comments, but feel free to add on to this document if you feel we should focus on anything else.
