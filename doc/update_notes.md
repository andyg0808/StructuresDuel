# Project Update Notes

## Comments from Prof. Smith:

1. Look into decreasing chance of outliers. (Are they because the JVM/caches
   have to warm up each time?)

    _What should we do about this? Any suggestions?_

1. Stick to the .95 power level, seeing as we have the tools to achieve this
   relatively easily compared to other groups. (Just my personal opinion, if
   everyone would like to switch to the .80 power because of convenience I'm
   perfectly fine with this too.)

    _What does everyone else think?_

1. Include an interaction plot for the final study.

1. There are a lot of red commas added throughout the document, look into
   formatting large numbers with commas for next time.

This concludes her comments. Some further questions brought up in our project update follow.

## Some other questions:

1. What, if anything, should we do about the possible interaction between
   operation and data structure type?

1. Where would we like to go with the so-called "lump sizes:" keep them over
   100,000 (the lump size used in the pilot study), or let them be what we
   originally planned (possibly missing things due to our known power
   requirements), or something else?
